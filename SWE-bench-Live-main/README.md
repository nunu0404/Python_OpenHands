SWE-bench-Live is a live benchmark for issue resolving, designed to evaluate an AI system's ability to complete real-world software engineering tasks. Thanks to our automated dataset curation pipeline, we plan to update SWE-bench-Live on a monthly basis to provide the community with up-to-date task instances and support rigorous and contamination-free evaluation.

## News
- **10/01/2026**: We tested the performance of GPT5.2 / Claude4.5 / Gemini3 / DeepseekV3.1 with SWE-agent / OpenHands / ClaudeCode on our new SWE-bench-Live/Multi-Language benchmark. Please refer to our leaderboard for result. [SWE-bench-Live Multi-Language Linux-Dist](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench-Live/MultiLang) benchmark has been officially released, together with RepoLaunch that supports (C C++ C# Python Java Go JS/TS Rust) languages & (Windows, Linux) images. Merged into main. For old source code SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live (Python-only, the NIPS paper version), refer to [python-only branch](https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live/tree/python-only).
- **04/12/2025**: We have updated eval result of GPT-5 and Claude-4.5 on our website. Though Claude might have seen the ground truth because its knowledge cutoff month is July 2025. We have also separated the RepoLaunch project to [RepoLaunch](https://github.com/microsoft/RepoLaunch/). Please contribute repolaunch agent relevant codes to this new repository. For more info please refer to [PR#35](https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live/pull/35).
- **09/17/2025**: Dataset updated (through 08/2025)! We’ve finalized the update process for huggingface dataset SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live (Python tasks): **Each month, we will add 50 newly verified, high-quality issues to the dataset test split**. The `lite` and `verified` splits will remain frozen, ensuring fair leaderboard comparisons and keeping evaluation costs manageable. To access all the latest issues, please refer to the `full` split!


## 🚀 Set Up

```bash
# Python >= 3.10
pip install -e .
```

> [!NOTE]
> Though this eval script has ensured backward compatibility with SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live (Python-only, the NIPS paper version), which uses swebench library for evaluation, if you want to evaluate on SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live (Python), for fair comparison we still recommend you to go to our old [Python-only branch](https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live/blob/python-only/README.md) and follow the old evaluation method.

The below eval script is more suitable for our new datasets SWE-bench-Live/MultiLang and SWE-bench-Live/Windows.


Test your installation by running:
```bash
python -m evaluation.evaluation \
    --dataset SWE-bench-Live/MultiLang \
    --instance_ids rsyslog__rsyslog-6047 \
    --platform linux \
    --patch_dir gold \
    --output_dir logs/test \
    --workers 1 \
    --overwrite 1
```

## 🚥 Evaluation

Evaluate your model on SWE-bench-Live.

Collect patch diff of your agent:

```bash
# unix
cd /testbed;
[ -d .git ] || { g=$(find . -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 -type d -name .git -print -quit); [ -n "$g" ] && cd "${g%/.git}"; } ;
git --no-pager diff HEAD  --text;
```

```powershell
# win
cd C:\testbed;
if (-not (Test-Path .git)) { $g = Get-ChildItem -Directory -Recurse -Depth 2 -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq '.git' } | Select-Object -First 1; if ($g) { Set-Location $g.Parent.FullName } };
git --no-pager diff HEAD  --text;

```

Prediction patch file format:

```json
{
    "instance_id1": {
        "model_patch": "git diff", 
        ...
    },
    "instance_id2": {
        "model_patch": "git diff", 
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

Evaluation command:

```bash
python -m evaluation.evaluation \
    --dataset SWE-bench-Live/SWE-bench-Live \
    # or SWE-bench-Live/MultiLang, SWE-bench-Live/Windows
    # or path to local dataset file like jsonl
    --split < refer to Huggingface SWE-bench-Live > \
    # if local jsonl file then ignore this field
    --platform linux \
    # or windows 
    --patch_dir <prediction patch> \
    --output_dir logs/test \
    --workers 10 \
    --overwrite 0 \
    # 0 for no and 1 for yes
```

Instance-level Docker images are hosted on DockerHub with name:

```python
def get_default_image_name(instance_id: str, platform: Literal["windows", "linux"]) -> str:
    if platform == "linux":
        med = "x86_64"
    else:
        med = "win"
    name = instance_id.replace("__", "_1776_").lower()
    image = f"starryzhang/sweb.eval.{med}.{name}"
    return image
```

### Dataset Curation

In SWE-bench-Live, we propose an automated pipeline for curating SWE-bench-like dataset.

### RepoLaunch

We addresses the bottleneck of setting up execution environments by automating the process through an LLM-based agentic tool – [RepoLaunch](https://github.com/microsoft/RepoLaunch). It can deliver a testable containerized environment for any given GitHub repository, thereby enabling test-based evaluation in SWE-bench-Live. 

### Collaboration

We welcome external collaborators to help us create more SWE tasks each month, and improve curation and launch source code. Please contact SWE-bench-Live@microsoft.com

Please feel free to raise issues and contribute pull requests to help us improve.
