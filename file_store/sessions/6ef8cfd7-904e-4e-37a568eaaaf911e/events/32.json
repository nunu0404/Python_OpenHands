The code currently attempts to import and use these providers before accessing the specified 'fake'. When the command `faker -i faker_credit_score credit_score` is issued, 'credit_score' is treated as a provider.\\n\\nTo fix this, the CLI logic should be modified to ensure that if the `-i` flag is used, any argument following it should be considered as fake data generation method names (fnames) rather than provider class names. However, the lack of a distinction between providers and fakes also suggests potential design flaws in how CLI arguments are processed.\\n\\nTo approach fixing the issue, we can:\\n1. Modify parsing logic to properly distinguish between providers and fakes.\\n2. Ensure that incorrect command usage won't attempt to treat the fake as a provider.\\n3. Test if the first CLI argument is a real provider or fake when `-i` is present.\\n4. Implement a fallback mechanism to verify provider existence only when necessary, avoiding incorrect early import attempts for fakes.\\n5. Maintain backward compatibility and prevent breaking existing expected behaviors.\\n\\nImplementation should focus on editing `execute()` method logic to manage argument order and behavior. The fix will ensure that once a fake is specified, subsequent arguments don't improperly affect provider importing.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_62MddHzQ7TTgDjF1aTGb8fXP", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 13788, "total_tokens": 14084, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 12288, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
