However, there's an issue in the `improper order` test case.\\n\\nIn the logic, when there isn't a `fake` specified before `-i`, the argument following `-i` becomes part of `fake_args`. This leads to a `TypeError` during the execution of `fake.format()`, as it attempts to call a non-existent formatter with incorrect arguments.\\n\\nTo resolve this issue:\\n\\n1. Modify the logic to ensure that arguments after `fake` are handled as arguments for the `fake`. Any arguments after `-i` should be treated as provider includes.\\n2. Implement a check in `execute()` to ensure proper handling and order verification of the arguments.\\n\\nThis could involve restructuring how arguments are parsed, possibly categorizing input types explicitly to ensure proper handling during the fake and provider setup.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_KYWibUEvkTbaLvzU9sqKNuLS", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 30786, "total_tokens": 30992, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 24320, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
