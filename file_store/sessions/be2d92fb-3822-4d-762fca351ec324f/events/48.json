Investigate existing rules or mechanisms in the repository that could be used to implement the required check.\\n2. Check the `src/cfnlint/rules/resources` directory to locate files or code that are responsible for AWS::S3::Bucket or tiering configurations.\\n3. Possible places to implement custom checks are within rule files in the `rules/resources` directory.\\n4. Edit the appropriate rule files to add validation for the `ARCHIVE_ACCESS` tier requirement where `Days` should be at least 90.\\n5.
