We're using AWS SAM to deploy the cloudformation template.\n\n\n\nCurrently this error is only caught (with a generic error message) at the time that cloudformation is deployed via `sam deploy`. \n\nIt would be great if this could be caught in static analysis - especially considering how updating cloudfront distributions via cloudformation is slow.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n```yml\n\nResources:\n\n  ReverseProxyCloudfrontDistribution:\n\n    Type: 'AWS::CloudFront::Distribution'\n\n    DependsOn:\n\n      - ReactProjectCloudfrontDistribution\n\n    Properties:\n\n      DistributionConfig:\n\n        Enabled: true\n\n        Comment: 'My Website Reverse Proxy'\n\n        HttpVersion: http2\n\n        Origins:\n\n          - Id: proxy-to-react-project\n\n            DomainName: !GetAtt ReactProjectCloudfrontDistribution.DomainName\n\n            CustomOriginConfig:\n\n              OriginProtocolPolicy: \"https-only\"\n\n          - Id: proxy-to-backend-orm\n\n            DomainName: 'staging.mywebsite.com'\n\n            CustomOriginConfig:\n\n              OriginProtocolPolicy: \"https-only\"\n\n        DefaultCacheBehavior:\n\n          Compress: 'true'\n\n          AllowedMethods:\n\n            - GET\n\n            - HEAD\n\n            - OPTIONS\n\n          ForwardedValues:\n\n            QueryString: true\n\n          # \n\n          # !!!!!!!!!!
