These false positives are probably caused by the try-with-resources byte code. Null resource values are valid in try-with-resources statements. Due to the scope of the resource variable, it would be inconvenient to move the null check outside the try-with-resources statement.\n\n\n\nApplying `@SuppressFBWarnings` to just the resource variable declaration also doesn't work.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Java environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the / directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a Java class to reproduce the error and execute it by first compiling with `javac <classname>.java` and then running with `java <classname>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.\n4. Rerun your reproduce script or class and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce class or script, and run them to make sure your fix handles these cases as well.\n6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit d925d366cd0cf2314921d32ebd39340ff0f04e50. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:\n   - The issue you are fixing\n   - The files you modified\n   - The functions or classes you changed\n   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n","metadata":{"agent_class":"CodeActAgent","llm_config":{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","api_key":"**********","base_url":"https://api.chatanywhere.org/v1","api_version":null,"aws_access_key_id":null,"aws_secret_access_key":null,"aws_region_name":null,"openrouter_site_url":"https://docs.all-hands.dev/","openrouter_app_name":"OpenHands","num_retries":5,"retry_multiplier":8.0,"retry_min_wait":8,"retry_max_wait":64,"timeout":null,"max_message_chars":30000,"temperature":0.0,"top_p":1.0,"top_k":null,"custom_llm_provider":null,"max_input_tokens":null,"max_output_tokens":null,"input_cost_per_token":null,"output_cost_per_token":null,"ollama_base_url":null,"drop_params":true,"modify_params":false,"disable_vision":null,"disable_stop_word":false,"caching_prompt":true,"log_completions":true,"log_completions_folder":"evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train/CodeActAgent/gpt-4o_maxiter_50_N_v1.2.1-no-hint-run_1/llm_completions/spotbugs__spotbugs-2844","custom_tokenizer":null,"native_tool_calling":null,"reasoning_effort":null,"seed":null,"safety_settings":null,"for_routing":false,"correct_num":5,"completion_kwargs":null},"agent_config":null,"max_iterations":50,"eval_output_dir":"evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train/CodeActAgent/gpt-4o_maxiter_50_N_v1.2.1-no-hint-run_1","start_time":"2026-02-01 15:19:52","git_commit":"e688fba761d896a80dfa6b05b7c2221620e7b8be","dataset":"__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train","data_split":null,"details":{},"condenser_config":{"type":"noop"},"instruction_template_name":null},"history":[{"id":0,"timestamp":"2026-02-01T15:20:30.185239","source":"agent","message":"You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\n* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation\n* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity\n* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them\n</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>","action":"system","args":{"content":"You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\n* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation\n* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity\n* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them\n</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.

Validate appropriate closure of each opened brace and method logic wrapper.\n\nI will make this correction now, aiming to clean up the syntactical structure.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":[{"function":{"arguments":"{\"command\":\"str_replace\",\"path\":\"/testbed/spotbugs/src/main/java/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/detect/LoadOfKnownNullValue.java\",\"old_str\":\"boolean isTryWithResourcesContext(\\n        InstructionHandle handle, InstructionHandle nextHandle,\\n        MethodGen methodGen) {\\n    return false;\\n}\",\"new_str\":\"private boolean isTryWithResourcesContext(InstructionHandle handle, InstructionHandle nextHandle, MethodGen methodGen) {\\n        // Implement logic to check if the instruction context is within try-with-resources\\n        // Placeholder implementation, should be replaced with actual logic\\n        return false;\\n    }\",\"security_risk\":\"MEDIUM\"}","name":"str_replace_editor"},"id":"call_2zv9AaZGgwtSDWzi2PyDV0IK","type":"function"}],"function_call":null,"provider_specific_fields":{"refusal":null},"annotations":[]},"provider_specific_fields":{}}],"usage":{"completion_tokens":260,"prompt_tokens":34016,"total_tokens":34276,"completion_tokens_details":{"accepted_prediction_tokens":null,"audio_tokens":0,"reasoning_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":null,"text_tokens":null,"image_tokens":null},"prompt_tokens_details":{"audio_tokens":0,"cached_tokens":9600,"text_tokens":null,"image_tokens":null}},"service_tier":null},"total_calls_in_response":1},"content":"The file /testbed/spotbugs/src/main/java/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/detect/LoadOfKnownNullValue.java has been edited.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Java environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the / directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a Java class to reproduce the error and execute it by first compiling with `javac <classname>.java` and then running with `java <classname>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.\n4. Rerun your reproduce script or class and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce class or script, and run them to make sure your fix handles these cases as well.\n6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit eaabea02874d70ee58757bccd514fd1c085124af. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:\n   - The issue you are fixing\n   - The files you modified\n   - The functions or classes you changed\n   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n","metadata":{"agent_class":"CodeActAgent","llm_config":{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","api_key":"**********","base_url":"https://api.chatanywhere.org/v1","api_version":null,"aws_access_key_id":null,"aws_secret_access_key":null,"aws_region_name":null,"openrouter_site_url":"https://docs.all-hands.dev/","openrouter_app_name":"OpenHands","num_retries":5,"retry_multiplier":8.0,"retry_min_wait":8,"retry_max_wait":64,"timeout":null,"max_message_chars":30000,"temperature":0.0,"top_p":1.0,"top_k":null,"custom_llm_provider":null,"max_input_tokens":null,"max_output_tokens":null,"input_cost_per_token":null,"output_cost_per_token":null,"ollama_base_url":null,"drop_params":true,"modify_params":false,"disable_vision":null,"disable_stop_word":false,"caching_prompt":true,"log_completions":true,"log_completions_folder":"evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train/CodeActAgent/gpt-4o_maxiter_50_N_v1.2.1-no-hint-run_1/llm_completions/spotbugs__spotbugs-3557","custom_tokenizer":null,"native_tool_calling":null,"reasoning_effort":null,"seed":null,"safety_settings":null,"for_routing":false,"correct_num":5,"completion_kwargs":null},"agent_config":null,"max_iterations":50,"eval_output_dir":"evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train/CodeActAgent/gpt-4o_maxiter_50_N_v1.2.1-no-hint-run_1","start_time":"2026-02-01 15:29:58","git_commit":"e688fba761d896a80dfa6b05b7c2221620e7b8be","dataset":"__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train","data_split":null,"details":{},"condenser_config":{"type":"noop"},"instruction_template_name":null},"history":[{"id":0,"timestamp":"2026-02-01T15:30:36.945351","source":"agent","message":"You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\n* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation\n* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity\n* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them\n</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>","action":"system","args":{"content":"You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\n* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation\n* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity\n* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them\n</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"execute_bash","description":"Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Java environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the / directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a Java class to reproduce the error and execute it by first compiling with `javac <classname>.java` and then running with `java <classname>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.\n4. Rerun your reproduce script or class and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce class or script, and run them to make sure your fix handles these cases as well.\n6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 8f1805df36885860b63fc1d5933a82304111ffa2. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved.

ask!","outputs":{},"thought":""}}],"metrics":{"accumulated_cost":0.647845,"max_budget_per_task":null,"accumulated_token_usage":{"model":"default","prompt_tokens":348710,"completion_tokens":3351,"cache_read_tokens":205952,"cache_write_tokens":0,"context_window":128000,"per_turn_token":18385,"response_id":""},"costs":[{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.010117500000000001,"timestamp":1769960091.2293048},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.008695000000000001,"timestamp":1769960092.831105},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.012530000000000003,"timestamp":1769960095.407464},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.014675,"timestamp":1769960097.1998951},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.013207500000000002,"timestamp":1769960098.8120303},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.01531,"timestamp":1769960100.7544677},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.03428500000000001,"timestamp":1769960106.7717845},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.023267500000000003,"timestamp":1769960109.2363353},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.0266775,"timestamp":1769960113.1962583},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.03541,"timestamp":1769960117.7271657},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.018447500000000002,"timestamp":1769960121.5688488},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.032975000000000004,"timestamp":1769960126.1737857},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.0204325,"timestamp":1769960129.2243252},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.03711,"timestamp":1769960134.0694406},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.030905000000000002,"timestamp":1769960139.8197558},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.024667500000000005,"timestamp":1769960143.184554},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.036305000000000004,"timestamp":1769960146.9042299},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.0368625,"timestamp":1769960152.3426514},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.033065000000000004,"timestamp":1769960157.0471966},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.021487500000000003,"timestamp":1769960159.7090971},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.0392425,"timestamp":1769960164.3058627},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.024720000000000002,"timestamp":1769960167.207689},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.023265000000000004,"timestamp":1769960172.4024816},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.022042500000000003,"timestamp":1769960174.7027667},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.025767500000000002,"timestamp":1769960339.547242},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","cost":0.026375000000000003,"timestamp":1769960346.5203948}],"response_latencies":[{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.6571552753448486,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlJHAVglFjwHiZrBguPQWsxk98p"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":1.58294677734375,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlMa3G81Uy1fHDi6SpkLJeNk0El"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":2.5176849365234375,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlOvOovbpZwuNYcDM9CoQcKEqtP"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":1.746349811553955,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlQhJ7QcCcXEQj2yYIIYYDNXxWe"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":1.5702509880065918,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlSZrbirrMZCqMcqGKQnveBroTT"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":1.9023969173431396,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlU8DDFj0DrsRjt80Tz7CgNIoiD"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":5.9560863971710205,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlWulk5NDBi8wj9csPtdZM7qrwT"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":2.429359197616577,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4Tlc0udyAGJ2q6nxlwKtPKqkadiI"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":2.756204843521118,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlgJW4xBbjGx9pb3LwNJRFW10wf"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.837928533554077,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlklZ151I1UlU3tGpyqGPPjmiqL"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.8178956508636475,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlnMR7SAwJuqarkUhoFb9w7LaH6"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":4.5764594078063965,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlrZWu48JyyymnH7gQVA1gnIUTc"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.0274901390075684,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TlwGZqDs0JRbaIetwycqNzudRs6"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":4.1531572341918945,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4Tm0eO0mYdJ5e69a9KgKeBhbv1gc"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":5.7287375926971436,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4Tm440XzfnPuj2JHoLtoLjdklXzN"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.3362014293670654,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4Tm9iB574hGxFWAJDOnisBsNY9s4"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.6973776817321777,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmDYCtbCBTNNZE3V92FpTR1A3rc"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":4.227585792541504,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmHaWcWmfQHioorc98R8gQA5Tr9"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":4.677281618118286,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmM0LLjYx1tFa4GHWYQvzcQKFdv"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":2.6232433319091797,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmQY9UNEkMiBGaWH6YGgs0OV6Y0"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":3.381666421890259,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmUnwctx3WgsfX9QwpYFJTEyFkL"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":2.874216079711914,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmYmzfl0rKNGR7I04mIwDRrw4L2"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","latency":4.491661548614502,"response_id":"chatcmpl-D4TmcQnnaIHtbybEQn2U6coQsvhQJ"},{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","laten

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Java environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the / directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a Java class to reproduce the error and execute it by first compiling with `javac <classname>.java` and then running with `java <classname>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3.

Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce class or script, and run them to make sure your fix handles these cases as well.\n6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 7e6fee8714396cb79d81aaecae5f5cd69e178d09. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:\n   - The issue you are fixing\n   - The files you modified\n   - The functions or classes you changed\n   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n","metadata":{"agent_class":"CodeActAgent","llm_config":{"model":"openai/gpt-4o","api_key":"**********","base_url":"https://api.chatanywhere.org/v1","api_version":null,"aws_access_key_id":null,"aws_secret_access_key":null,"aws_region_name":null,"openrouter_site_url":"https://docs.all-hands.dev/","openrouter_app_name":"OpenHands","num_retries":5,"retry_multiplier":8.0,"retry_min_wait":8,"retry_max_wait":64,"timeout":null,"max_message_chars":30000,"temperature":0.0,"top_p":1.0,"top_k":null,"custom_llm_provider":null,"max_input_tokens":null,"max_output_tokens":null,"input_cost_per_token":null,"output_cost_per_token":null,"ollama_base_url":null,"drop_params":true,"modify_params":false,"disable_vision":null,"disable_stop_word":false,"caching_prompt":true,"log_completions":true,"log_completions_folder":"evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train/CodeActAgent/gpt-4o_maxiter_50_N_v1.2.1-no-hint-run_1/llm_completions/mapstruct__mapstruct-3492","custom_tokenizer":null,"native_tool_calling":null,"reasoning_effort":null,"seed":null,"safety_settings":null,"for_routing":false,"correct_num":5,"completion_kwargs":null},"agent_config":null,"max_iterations":50,"eval_output_dir":"evaluation/evaluation_outputs/outputs/__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train/CodeActAgent/gpt-4o_maxiter_50_N_v1.2.1-no-hint-run_1","start_time":"2026-02-01 15:29:58","git_commit":"e688fba761d896a80dfa6b05b7c2221620e7b8be","dataset":"__home__kjh__main__Java_OpenHands__evaluation__benchmarks__multi_swe_bench__data__new_java_examples.jsonl-train","data_split":null,"details":{},"condenser_config":{"type":"noop"},"instruction_template_name":null},"history":[{"id":0,"timestamp":"2026-02-01T15:44:18.052117","source":"agent","message":"You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively.

I would expect this build method to be found and used. \n\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n\n\nI get a compilation error \"Person does not have an accessible constructor.\"\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\n\n\n```java\n\n// provided by library\n\npublic interface EntityBuilder<T> {\n\n    T build();\n\n}\n\n\n\n// provided by library\n\npublic class Person {\n\n    private final String name;\n\n\n\n    private Person(String name) {\n\n        this.name = name;\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    public static Builder builder() {\n\n        return new BuilderImpl();\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    public interface Builder extends EntityBuilder<Person> {\n\n        Builder name(String name);\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    private static final class BuilderImpl implements Builder {\n\n        private String name;\n\n\n\n        private BuilderImpl() {\n\n        }\n\n\n\n        public Builder name(String name) {\n\n            this.name = name;\n\n            return this;\n\n        }\n\n\n\n        @Override\n\n        public Person build() {\n\n            return new Person(name);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n\n//my own dto\n\npublic record PersonDto(String name) {\n\n}\n\n\n\n@Mapper\n\npublic interface PersonMapper {\n\n    Person map(PersonDto source);\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\nFrom my quick debugging it looks like the problem is that https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/blob/main/processor/src/main/java/org/mapstruct/ap/spi/DefaultBuilderProvider.java#L240 does not yield the `build` method\n\n\n\n### MapStruct Version\n\n\n\n1.5.5.Final\n","FAIL_TO_PASS":"[]","PASS_TO_PASS":"[]","base_commit":"7e6fee8714396cb79d81aaecae5f5cd69e178d09","version":"0.1"}}
